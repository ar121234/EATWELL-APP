This frontend is purely developed using reactJS as a framework. It is breaked down into many components through which it gives you capability to customize every bit of it without any issue. For now It has just a fine styling , it can be styled into a good looking frontend. The navigation bar just link to google.com for now , we can customize as per our requirment. Even we can refer another page with say for form as ex. , and create a single page application.   The backend is created using ExpressJS framework. It has only one route which responds you the calories of the food that came along with the request . It filters the json object from a file in the backend and based upon the food name from the request , it returns the corresponding calorie value to the frontend. CORS issue is resolved. It allows everyone to access the resources.
